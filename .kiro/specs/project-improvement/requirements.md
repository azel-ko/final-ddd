# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the current project's deployment strategy, script management, configuration organization, and infrastructure components. The goal is to simplify deployment away from Docker Compose/Swarm/Nomad, consolidate scattered scripts, standardize on PostgreSQL as the default database, organize configuration files, and replace Traefik with a better reverse proxy solution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simplified deployment strategy that doesn't rely on Docker Compose, Swarm, or Nomad, so that I can deploy my application more easily and with better control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating deployment options THEN the system SHALL provide alternatives to Docker Compose, Swarm, and Nomad
2. WHEN choosing a deployment method THEN it SHALL be simpler to configure and maintain than current solutions
3. WHEN deploying the application THEN it SHALL support both development and production environments
4. IF using containerization THEN it SHALL use a more straightforward approach than current orchestration tools

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all project scripts consolidated and organized, so that I can easily find and execute the scripts I need without searching through multiple directories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN looking for build scripts THEN they SHALL be located in a single, well-organized directory structure
2. WHEN executing common tasks THEN there SHALL be a unified script interface or Makefile
3. WHEN scripts are consolidated THEN duplicate functionality SHALL be eliminated
4. WHEN scripts are organized THEN they SHALL be categorized by purpose (build, deploy, development, etc.)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want PostgreSQL as the default database configuration, so that I can simplify database setup and focus on a single, robust database solution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL default to PostgreSQL configuration
2. WHEN database configuration is loaded THEN PostgreSQL SHALL be the primary option
3. WHEN other database support is maintained THEN it SHALL be optional and clearly documented
4. WHEN migrating existing configurations THEN PostgreSQL settings SHALL take precedence

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want organized and clean configuration files, so that I can easily understand and modify application settings without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration files are organized THEN they SHALL follow a clear hierarchical structure
2. WHEN looking for specific configurations THEN they SHALL be grouped by functionality or environment
3. WHEN configuration files are cleaned up THEN unused or redundant configurations SHALL be removed
4. WHEN configurations are structured THEN they SHALL use consistent naming conventions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a better reverse proxy solution than Traefik, so that I can have more reliable and easier-to-configure load balancing and routing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating reverse proxy options THEN alternatives to Traefik SHALL be recommended
2. WHEN choosing a reverse proxy THEN it SHALL be easier to configure than Traefik
3. WHEN the reverse proxy is implemented THEN it SHALL support SSL termination and load balancing
4. WHEN migrating from Traefik THEN existing routing functionality SHALL be preserved
5. IF using Nginx or similar THEN configuration SHALL be straightforward and well-documented
